        <blockquote>
            "Some people become depressed at the scale of the universe, because it makes them feel 
            insignificant. Other people are relieved to feel insignificant, which is even worse. 
            But, in any case, those are mistakes. Feeling insignificant because the universe is 
            large has exactly the same logic as feeling inadequate for not being a cow. Or a herd 
            of cows. The universe is not there to overwhelm us; it is our home, and our resource. 
            The bigger the better."
